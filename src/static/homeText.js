The education system of Malawi is quite different than that of US education. 
All children receive education up to elementary level.  
However, most girls do not receive higher education beyond primary level education.  
Since middle school and high school education is paid for by individual families 
most parents opt to pay only for the boys in their homes.  Malawi Compassion desires to support further 
education by providing tuition for girls beyond primary age education.  
They are bright young girls that do not receive fair education opportunities as the boys do 
and we think this is unfair for them.

Many women are at disadvantage because they do not have marketable skills.  
In this modern world where many women are educated and equipped that prepares 
them for the job market some of these women do not have marketable skills that 
will get them jobs.  If some of them are single mothers it puts them at risk 
and makes them vulnerable to dangerous and undesirable jobs.  It is 
heart-breaking to witness such infair treatment of women in parts of the world 
where they are still treated as second class citizens.  The ministries in Malawi 
train these women in seamstress skills and it only takes $200 to buy a sewing 
machine to train these women to get a decent job to support their families.

export const thirdHomeText = `
Malawi along with other parts of African continent has two distinct seasons for farming.  
When it pours it really pours in this part of the continent.  During rainy season 
farming is excellent.  However, during drought season there is no water available for 
farming.  So some of the farmland get extremely dry and kills most of the crops.  
This sets the farmers back in their production and they have nothing to live in for 
the remainder of the year.  To avoid this they need access to underground water wells.  
It's our desire to provide enough water well bore holes to help farmers access water for 
their farm.  One machine will help multiple farmers and we desire to buy and lend out the 
machines to help many farmers dig water wells.
